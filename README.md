### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I work on the Cult Live product at cult.fit, Bengaluru which brings live fitness classes to your home via your phone. Implemented a debugging framework to help look into issues at a user level, and a way to AB test different ML models for energy score calculation. I tweet frequently about the tech landscape and thought experiments on Twitter: [@paramaggarwal](https://twitter.com/paramaggarwal)

At Flipkart I designed the frontend vernacular language handling solution for web & react-native properties and led implementation of app/web UI changes for pre-booking functionality. At Craftworks, we explored new ideas and converted them to products with the possibility of eventually spinning them out into independent companies. We explored revamping HR tools to be data-driven instead of subscription-revenue driven (called Caliber) - similar to how Gmail had disrupted email services. At Myntra, I worked on the PHP to Node.js migration for the desktop and mobile websites. I was the first developer on the iOS app and I eventually helped migrate large parts of the iOS app to React Native. We also explored chat-bots.

In the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree at Udacity, we drove a car in a simulated environment to obey traffic signs purely based on camera data. I worked on building sensor fusion and localization algorithms as well as sophisticated car control in a simulated environment. I also worked on multiple projects related to lane and vehicle detection as well as traffic sign classification that use deep learning and computer vision techniques.
